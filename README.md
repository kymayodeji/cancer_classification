# Cancer Classification

## Objective
Determine an optimal classification model to use to detect breast cancer using the results of various fine needle aspirations (FNA) of patient breast masses. 

## Data
Popular Breast Cancer Prediction dataset is from the University of Wisconsin Hospital: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data.  Dataset features are computed from digitized images of Fine Meedle Aspirate (FNA) of patient breast masses. Dataset includes a primary key ID and a Diagnosis column with values of B (benign) or M (malignment). Each observation has real-valued feature columns describing various characteristics of the cell nuclei along with the Mean, Standard Error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features computed for each image. Example: field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.
